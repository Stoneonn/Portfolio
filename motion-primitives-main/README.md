# Motion-Primitives

Beautifully designed, easy-to-integrate motion components for engineers and designers, built with [motion](https://motion.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

**This project is in beta. Expect new components to be released regularly and significant updates to the code.**
